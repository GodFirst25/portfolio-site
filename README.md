Check out what I'm up to!
This is my official website coded from scratch to fully learn web development and design. 
Here, you can catch latest update of projects, experiences, and lifestyle regarding web development,
music, tech, and film in general which will be on my blog (coming soon). I might throw in some random lifestyle update that focuses on faith, trust, and love. So be on the lookout for that!

But for now, welcome to my official website which focuses on my projects and work experiences! Feel free to reach out to me by leaving a comment about what you liked and what you would love to see and by God's grace, if it is doable, then it will be done!



Let's dive in!

For this website, I'll be making use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

HTML

First, we structured the website using HTML, where we included the nav bar to move to different sections
of the page such as Home, About, Portfolio, Blog, and Contact.

The Home and About section along with the contact section will be on the same page. While the Portfolio and Blog section will on separate web page for each. 

- The Home section will be the first thing to be seen where the nav bar and logo with my name will be included and a brief explanation for the purpose of this website.
- The About section includes a brief description of who I am and why I do what I do
- The Contact section will be placed in the footer which will provide my contact information and also include a form which consist of text input, email input, text area for users' comment, and submit button so that I can receive their messages.

Lastly, update the portfolio page every three months with new experiences, projects, and skills.

CSS

The Home section has to be styled in a neutral and aesthetic way that portrays who I am as a person. 
Use colors that corresponds with dark/light mode transformation.


JavaScript

The contact information will need some interactivity with the use of form tag.
Also an inclusion of dark and light mode in the Home and Portfolio page. 






Future Updates

- Make use of Bootstrap or React for more accessibility and Node.js for more interactivity on the site.
- Upgrade the contact which is in the footer to have its own page where you can see the users' comment. MySQL will be a very good contribution to this.
- Include Dark/Light mode in all the web pages including the blog.
